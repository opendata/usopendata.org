After one long year of alpha testing, which started on [August 19th 2014](https://usopendata.org/2014/08/19/dat-alpha/), we are excited to announce our launch into a new, even more stable phase of dat. [Beta starts today](https://github.com/maxogden/dat).

Get started and and break things (but don't forget to let us know):
```
npm install -g dat
```

Let us know what you're working on and how dat might work for you, and we will even come to your lab to help you get up and running, implement features, and fix bugs in real time. First-class service!

We've been testing dat with the generous help of physicists, data hackers, machine learning experts, biostatisticians, gov't developers, sociologists, and informaticians. We brought our work to [Mozilla Science Lab to integrate with Federated Wiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKpJgNoT1b8), [the Sanger Institute to show off dat+bionode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKpJgNoT1b8), [Berkeley Institute for Data Science where one of us coworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psmtJUyZHE0), [ROpenSci to talk about visual diffing](http://unconf.ropensci.org/), [JSConf to get our nerd on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM3Pr7tfHF0), and [to SRCCON to demo with Flatsheet](http://srccon.org/docs/transcripts/datflatsheet/), just to name a few.

Finally, we've landed on an internal and external design that we believe covers the key use cases in data science collaboration with open data. With dat beta, you now can:
  1) **[Put multiple data tables in a single repository](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md#31-importing-datasets)**. With dat alpha, the entire dat was one tabular entity -- but now, dat supports complex, heterogeneous datasets composed of different schemas or types of files. Datasets are kind of like SQL tables, except these datasets don't support robust querying or joins.
  2) **[Trust versions with cryptographic accuracy](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md#32-versioning)**. Versions are now represented as uniquely identifiable sha256 hashes, and you can attach a message and timestamp for a coarse-grained view of the data's history. You can also easily, and quickly (O(1)) revert to a historical version to view and edit the data.
  3) **[Fork, diff and merge](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md#34-one-thousand-forks-when-all-you-need-is-a-knife-isnt-irony)**.  Although forks could be represented as conflicts to be merged immediately (as one might expect in a version control system such as Git), dat's philosophy is the opposite. We think that data tools should embrace forks as key support for experimentation during the scientific process. Now dat is a decentralized, versioned, [Merkle DAG](https://github.com/mafintosh/merkle-dag) so, FORK AWAY!
  4) **[Deploy over HTTP or SSH](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/cookbook.md)** Dat is transport agnostic and easy to deploy. This means IT support is happy because your existing authentication schemes should work the same as ever. Feel free to give read-only access through HTTP, too.
  5) **[Integrate with other backend engines](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/cookbook.md#how-do-i-connect-a-different-backend-to-dat)** Now you can use dat on top of any database that implements the [AbstractLevelDOWN api](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown) -- that means postgresql, redis, mongo, google drive ... the list goes on. This feature is one of the many that still need extensive testing, but we are excited about the prospect.

After being granted the security to continue working on dat for the next two years, [courtesy of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://usopendata.org/2015/04/03/sloan/), we are doubling down on reliability on our approach to a full-featured 1.0 release in the coming months. But we can't do it without your help -- really. Every little piece of feedback counts, and we're particularly looking for help with bug testing, feature requesting, and integration with existing data sharing systems. We can't wait to see your feedback, comments, questions, and pull requests.

Read more about the motivation and design of dat's new beta in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/docs/whitepaper.md#32-versioning). We're mostly always available in #dat on [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net), or [datproject/discussions on gitter.im](https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions), so join us!
