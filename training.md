# Open Data Training

The U.S. Open Data does not offer any open data training. However, [the Open Data Institute of North Carolina](http://theodinc.org) (ODI NC), does. They’ve  redeveloped the UK ODI
training courses to suit the U.S. market, using accredited, [ODI-Registered Trainers](http://theodi.org/what-is-an-odi-registered-trainer) to assure quality of training. This is the only
ODI training available in the United States.

For more information, please visit [the ODI NC Training Site](http://training.theodinc.org) 
or [e-mail the ODI NC Training Team](mailto:training@theodinc.org).
